- [ ] First explore the use of SAPIEN
    - [] first run `hello_world.py`, learn the viewer and render. How to use them.
- [ ] Try to run the file lift.py, understand if there is any trainning
- [ ] Next try to run the PPO.ipynb, understand how PPO works
- [ ] Try to combine both of them, while remember to make the cube location to be a random place? How would the robot try to find it?
- [ ] first train at a single (0,0) cube. If could first partially succeed, then try dynamic box location.
- [ ] add location as an input to the neural network? both or just one? I think both. And then try to test again.
